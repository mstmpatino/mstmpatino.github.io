This final project encoumpassed all of the skills learned in this class (e.g. while loops, for loops, global variables, functions, classes, if/else statements, built-in python operations, local variables, lists, parameters, and print). 

The objective of the project was to create a code that allowed the user to choose different options creating a family tree. The user can add a relative, delete a relative, or update information that will be processed and stored. 



I have attached a link to the code written, but it needs to be copied and pasted into a program capable of running python programs.
